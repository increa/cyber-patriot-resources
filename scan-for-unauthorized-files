Cyber Patriot Linux folks,

Try this to quickly search any directory and subdirectory for unauthorized file types using native bash, even when they are named something else.

$ sudo find . -type f | file -Nz -f - | grep -f ~/badtypes.txt

N avoids extra spaces and tabs in the output for prettiness
z looks into compressed files

Just put anything you want to find in the text file badtypes.txt in your home directory, such as
JPEG
MP4
MPEG
ASF

{or more..}

Test it out and let me know if you find any issues.

If you want to find any other type of fingerprint in files, you can specify the byte sequence pretty easily in the file command magic file.  Just Google "linux file command magic"
